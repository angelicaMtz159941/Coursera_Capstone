    "Nowadays, if a person wanted to open a new business, be it a restaurant, a cafeteria, a flower shop, a hairdresser, a dental office, a pharmacy, a gym or any business that comes to mind, it is necessary to study the area where you would like your business to be located. From my point of view, many factors need to be considered.\n",
    "Mexico city is one of the most over populated cities in the world, just in my neighborhood there is a grocery store on every corner, for every 4 streets there is a gym and so many similar cases.
